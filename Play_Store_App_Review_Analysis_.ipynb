        "3. The merged data frame of both play store and user reviews, had only 816 common apps. This is just 10% of the cleaned data, we could have given more valuable analysis, if we had atleast 70% - 80% of the data available in the merged dataframes.\n",
        "4. User Reviews had 42% of NaN values, which could have been used for developing an understanding of the category wise sentiments, which would help us to fill 13.60% NaN values of the Reviews column.\n",
        "5. There is so much more which can be explored. Like we have current version, android version available which can be explored in detail and we can come out with more analysis where we can tell how does these things effect and needs to be kept in mind while developing app for the users.\n",
        "6. We can explore the correlation between the size of the app and the version of Android on the number of installs.\n",
        "7. Machine learning can help us to deploy more insights by developing models which can help us interpret even more better. We have left this as future work as this is something where we can work on."
